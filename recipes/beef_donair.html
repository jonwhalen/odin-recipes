    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Yummy beef donairs. An Atlantic Canadian delicacy...</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Loaf</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground oregano</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 fluid ounce) can of evaporated milk (Eaglebrand recommended)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>4 teaspoons white vinegar, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Beef Donair</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To make the loaf, mix together salt, oregano, flour, black pepper, 
            Italian seasoning, garlic powder, onion powder, and cayenne 
            pepper in a cup or small bowl.</li>
        <li>Place ground beef in a large steel mixing bowl on a sturdy 
            surface; use your hands to blend in spice mixture. Pick up 
            meat and throw it down with force about 20 times, kneading 
            it after each throw. This will help meat hold together better 
            when sliced.</li>
        <li>Form meat into a loaf; place on a broiler pan or baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes, rotating 
            loaf halfway through to ensure even baking. Serve warm with 
            sauce or allow meat to chill before slicing and reheating.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Donair Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix together evaporated milk, sugar, and garlic powder in a 
            medium bowl. Gradually whisk in white vinegar, 1 teaspoon 
            at a time, until thickened to your desired consistency.</li>
    </ol>
